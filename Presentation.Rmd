## Overview


\vspace{0.5cm}

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- Goal: build a model to predict WAR (Wins Above Replacement)
- \textbf{WAR measures a player’s total contribution} compared to a replacement-level player
  - It combines multiple aspects of performance: hitting, baserunning, defensive value, positional difficulty, and their playing time, and puts it into a single number.
  - Interpreted as the number of additional wins a player adds to a team
  - Since it provides a single encompassing measure of a player's value, WAR is greatly relied on by MLB front offices

## Motivation

\vspace{0.5cm}

- Can a player's current-season performance statistics be used to predict their next season Wins Above Replacement (WAR)?

- Major League Baseball teams rely heavily on WAR to evaluate a players value, make contract decisions, and project roster needs. 
- It provide a competitive advantage for a team by:
  - Helps identify declining players
  - Allows for budgeting and contract planning
  - Encourages player development and roster optimization 
  

- Our goal is, by using statistical and machine learning models, we will:
  - Identify which player statistics best predict future WAR
  - Compare the performance of three different statistical learning models: OLS, LASSO, and BOOSTING
  - Build a model that maintains high predictive accuracy


## Data used 

\vspace{0.7em}

- Our data came from baseball-reference.com

- We used standard batting data from 2020-2025 to build our models (500 obs each year)
  - 2020-2024 was used for training
  - 2025 was our test data set 
  
- Variables: 
  - WAR, age, games played, plate appearances, at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, RBIs, stolen bases, caught stealing, walks, strikeouts, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS percentage, OPS+, rOBA, 
Rbat+, total bases, double plays grounded into, hit by pitch, sacrifice hits, sacrifice flies, intentional walks


## Models Used 

\vspace{0.5cm}

<div class="columns">
<div class="column" width = "33.3%">

- OLS
  - Baseline linear model
  - Benchmark for comparing models
  
</div>
<div class="column" width = "33.3%">

- LASSO
  - Feature selection through L1 regularization 

</div>
<div class="column" width = "33.3%">

- Boosting
  - Tree based method
  - Good at capturing non-linear patterns
  
  
</div>
</div>


## OLS Models

\vspace{0.5cm}

- OLS identifies and measures the relationship between a response variable and predictor variables.

  - Finds a best-fitting line through a set of data points

- Pros: Convenient, accurate regression results for linearly related data

- Cons: May be too simplistic for real world examples, assumptions of Linear Regression

## OLS Metrics Plot

\vspace{0.5cm}

<div class="columns">
<div class="column" width = "40%">

- Error metrics for both final testing data set (2025) and the training data split into training and testing sets
- Significant terms:
  - age, games played, plate appearances, at bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, stolen bases, caught stealing,
  walks, strikeouts, OPS+

```

## LASSO Models

\vspace{0.5cm}

- LASSO models perform regularization (L1), which shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero 

  - Essentially feature selection 
  
- Pros: Produces a more interpretative model, prevents over fitting

- Cons: LASSO performs poorly when predictors are highly correlated

<div class="columns">
<div class="column" width = "40%">

- Error metrics for both final testing data set (2025) and the training data split into training and testing sets
- Shrunk terms:
  - Plate appearances, home runs, RBIs, batting average, on base percentage, OPS+, rOBA

```

## Boosting Models 

\vspace{0.5cm}

- Boosting grows trees sequentially using information from previously grown trees  

  - Each tree fit on a modified version of the original data set  

\vspace{0.4cm}

- Pros: High predictive accuracy and captures complex, nonlinear relationships automatically.

- Cons: Prone to overfitting and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to perform well.

## Key Findings
\vspace{0.5cm}

- OLS performed the best overall
  - Lowest prediction error
  - Highest explained variance
- LASSO selected a subset of meaningful predictors, making it easier to understand which player stats drive WAR
- Variables with a strong predictive value: plate apperances, home runs, hits, OPS+, walks, and strikouts
- WAR prediction is challenging
  - some components are hard to obtain from batting-only statistics
  - player injuries, playing time, or other extrnal factors produce noise
